# DataStructures-search-engine
Search engine written for Data Structures course at Yeshiva University during the Spring 2023 semester.
Implemented:
- Stack
- Heap
- HashMap
- Trie
- B-Tree

Used the above data structures to build a search engine that works with the file system & manages internal memory usage. Tested each part with JUnit.
